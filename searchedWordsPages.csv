Two months after her death he married Jeanne van Schelle (or van Schellen or van Schallen), with whom he had two more children of whom Michiel the Younger became a painter.', "" The painter's whereabouts from the 1570s are not entirely clear.  In October 1572 Spanish troops plundered "", ' for three days after retaking the city from an army under the command of ', 'William the Silent', ', the leader of the Dutch Revolt.  The event known as the ', ' caused many local painters to flee to Antwerp.  Coxie was outside of the country, possibly in Spain, when the events happened.  His house was plundered and some painters from Antwerp were able to buy back some tapestry designs which Spanish soldiers had looted from his home.', 'Upon his return to Flanders, Coxie stayed in Mechelen and took on two pupils in his workshop.  However, Mechelen had become a cultural wasteland while Antwerp offered attractive opportunities as many of the altarpieces which had been destroyed needed to be replaced and its leading history painters ', ' had just died.  He completed an altarpiece in Antwerp in 1575 and was registered in the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp in 1578.  He remained in Antwerp during the period from 1580 to 1585 when the city was governed by a Calvinist government.

The continued appreciation of the Spanish king for the elderly artist was demonstrated when in 1589, he granted him an annuity. Coxie continued painting even when he was over 90 years old.. His last work, dated 1592, was the ', 'Triptych of the Legend of Santa Gudula', ', today in the ', ' in Brussels.

Shortly thereafter, he died after accidentally falling off a scaffold while working on the restoration of the ', ' in the ', ' that he had made nine years earlier for the Antwerp City Council.', 'Coxie was a prolific artists, who painted altarpieces and portraits and produced designs for stained-glass windows, tapestries and prints.  He was skilled in the traditional Flemish oil on panel technique as well as the Italian fresco technique.  His career spanned almost the entire 16th century.  He operated a large workshop which ensured a large output which contributed to his lifetime reputation and influence.  After his death his work soon fell into oblivion as it was overtaken quickly by the triumphant Baroque style introduced into Flanders by Rubens, another Flemish artist who had studied and worked for an extended time in Italy.\n', ""His style is a unique synthesis of the Flemish and Italian artistic traditions. His presumed master Bernard van Orley had possibly never studied in Italy but had certainly familiarised himself with the new pictorial vocabulary of the Italian Renaissance through his study of the designs of Raphael.  These designs had been brought to Brussels.  He had responded to Raphael's work by making the ﬁgures in his altarpieces more monumental and heroic. He also included classical architecture in his compositions.  During his stay in Rome, Coxie was able to directly study the works of Raphael, Michelangelo and other Renaissance painters as well as study the works of Antiquity that were being rediscovered at the time.  He also read classical literature and philosophy and was aware of the intellectual discussions on the reception of Antique art in Italy.  The panel "", "" which he likely painted during his stay in Rome is an attempt by Coxie to express these visual and philosophical influences.  The painting references Plato's ideas expressed in his "", ' about how art imitates nature and sometimes deviates from perfect imitation by changing the proportions in order for the viewer to get a true appreciation of the real object.  Coxie deals in ', ' with the question about how art can properly depict reality and what art can tell us about that reality. Only the viewer of the painting can see the way out of the cave, and according to Plato, this search should be the object of all true philosophy.  In ', "" Coxie borrows heavily from Michelangelo's models as well as from Antique models.

It is a monumental triptych showing at the centre the Virgin Mary with her mother Anna, Christ and John the Baptist. The scene is set in an overwhelming Renaissance architecture with many figures.', ' With this work Coxie showed that he had mastered the Italian style, while not abandoning his roots. The painting has many Italian characteristics. The figure of the Virgin, for instance, goes back directly to Da Vinci. The architectural columns, drapes and niches were inspired by Raphael.

Unfortunately, Solano and Tapia, the two officers on whom Arteaga put the security of the republican army, had betrayed him and switched sides over to the Imperial Mexican Army after being bribed with money.', 'By the time Méndez learned of the capture of Arteaga and Salazar, he had already recently received news on the recent law by ', ' on October 3, 1865, which without any trial, sentenced any defender of the Republic to death. The prisoners were taken to Uruapan and received the news that they would be shot on October 21.', ' Along with the two generals, Lieutenant Colonel Trinidad Villagómez, Colonel Jesús Díaz Ruiz and Captain Juan González would taste the bitter cup of the gallows.\n', 'In a humble moment, Arteaga asked Salazar not to let him waver, to help him stand up in front of the platoon with courage and dignity. Salazar hugged him and said: ""Don\'t worry General, we are going to show you how men die.""', ' The bells of the village parish announced 5 in the morning. In the previous days it had rained in the surroundings, so the atmosphere smelled of damp earth. It was cold. The prisoners were taken from their cell and firmly walked to the main square of Uruapan. The five prisoners stood in front of the platoon. Arteaga stepped forward and said: "" I die defending the integrity of my country, not as a general, but as a citizen. ""». When he finished, he took his place again. Salazar, without moving, unbuttoned his shirt and showed the shooters where the heart was, and in an unshakeable voice he said: ""I\'m going to show how a loyal Republican killed by traitors dies.""', ' The platoon followed orders carefully and hearing fire, a loud volley broke the silence. The bodies immediately fell to the ground, pierced by bullets.\n', 'By the end of 1868, the Federal Government and the State of Michoacán agreed to transfer the bodies to ', '. A year later, on Friday June 25, 1869, they were exhumed from their grave and left the land they defended until death. The mortal remains arrived in Mexico City on July 15 due to the posthumous tributes of the itinerary, and on Saturday July 17, 1869 they were finally placed in special crypts in the Civil Pantheon of San Fernando, which has become the place of the illustrious characters of the 19th century in Mexico.', '""Jose Maria Arteaga: The streets of Monterey""', 'Text is available under the ', ';\nadditional terms may apply.

It is based on the 1994 novel ', ' in 1997 concurrent with the film) by ', '. The miniseries is about an amphibious shark-like monster terrorizing an abandoned secret military base and the people who live on the island where it is located.\n', ' island. He follows Peniston (Esposito) into the facility. The head scientist Dr. Bishop (Reineke) shows them the projects he is working on, including a shark and Human hybrid with the ability to adapt to any environment, (the creature). It breaks free from its tank and kills Dr. Bishop. Richland orders Peniston to kill it, but Peniston instead traps the Creature in a containment unit and dumps it in the sea.\n', '25 years later Dr. Chase (Nelson), a marine biologist working in the same island, and his assistant, Tall Man (Williams), find a pregnant female ', "" trapped in Ben Mediera's (Alyward) nets. Dr. Chase sets it free. Meanwhile, a local fisherman, Puckett (Burke), retrieves the containment unit and accidentally releases the creature. Mediera is later eaten by the creature. Dr. Chase and Tall Man meet Dr. Macy (Cattrall), her "", "" named Robin, and Dr. Chase's son, Max (Carey), at the airport. As Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy prepare to go out on the ocean, Max goes into town. He meets the native kids including Elizabeth (Echikunwoke), the chief's daughter. The local boys tell him he'll have to take the test of bravery and jump from a tall cliff.\n"", 'Mediera\'s body is found and police Chief Gibson asks Dr. Chase to inspect the body. Chase says even though there is a great white out there it is not the culprit and tells the chief not to let people go after the innocent shark. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy leave and prepare to go out and find the real culprit. Tall Man arrives, escorted by his girlfriend, Tauna (Michele). Peniston, who has gone crazy and is called ""Werewolf"" by the locals, sees the empty containment unit after Puckett brings it ashore. He realizes Mediera was not killed by a shark. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy are unable to find the Creature and return to Dr. Chase\'s headquarters (formerly the research facility where the creature was born). Dr. Macy reveals Dr. Chase studies why sharks do not get cancer, which his brother Brian died from.\nMeanwhile, the kids take turns jumping of the cliff, unaware the creature is lurking right below them. Max and another boy named Kimo jump in. The creature mauls Kimo to death, but Max escapes. When Kimo\'s body is found, the chief is furious and, no longer listening to Dr. Chase, orders all the fisherman to hunt for the great white. The islanders, including Puckett, accuse Chase and Macy of performing ', "" on the shark. Dr. Chase, Dr. Macy, Max and Tall Man search for the Creature again; this time with success. The creature attacks their boat, but they escape. By this time, Puckett has retrieved the great white, which was previously attacked by the Creature. The islanders celebrate, believing the danger is past. Dr. Chase tells the chief that they are not safe and that he has seen the Creature. However, the chief refuses to believe him. They do research at Dr. Chase's headquarters, and are soon put into contact with Richland. Richland tells Dr. Chase not to do anything until he arrives. Dr. Chase argues that more people could die if they do not take action but Richland does not care. Richland and a troop of NAVY SEALs board a helicopter and set off for the island. Dr. Chase ignores Richland's warning and goes back out into his boat. Peniston uses a horn to attract the creature, which is attracted to noise. The creature attacks him, but Dr. Chase and friends save him. They bring him back to their headquarters.\n"", ""The next day Dr. Chase discovers claw marks on his boat (proof of his theory of the Great White's innocence). Later, Peniston shows them a secret tunnel leading to the actual research facility. Meanwhile, Richland and the SEALs approach the island in their helicopter. Dr. Chase and Dr. Macy go down the tunnel and discover it to be half flooded, most likely connected to the ocean. They also discover equipment and notes. They find some of Puckett's traps and wonder how they got there. By the time they realize who brought them, it is too late; the creature ambushes them. They run and the creature gives pursuit, but is only able to go so far until it can't catch up because its arms and legs are short and weak out of water. It stops and evolves its arms and legs until they are like that of a human. The creature resumes chase. The doctor and her friends manage to escape and reseal the tunnel blocking the creature. They leave the research facility by boat. The creature attacks them when they reach the dock. It is about to kill Max, but then lets him live.\n"", ""Dr. Macy goes to the town doctor and says that she has claw wounds. Dr. Chase discusses the encounter with Chief Gibson, but he still refuses to believe. They decide to send Max back to the States. Elizabeth stops him and says that she can't find her cousin. Elizabeth claims the only place she could be is at the old rum factory (which is now used as a club and place for teenagers to go). They then leave to find it. Puckett goes diving and is killed by the creature. Dr. Chase, Dr. Macy, and Peniston return to headquarters only to be ambushed by Richland and his thugs. He sends a few of his cronies to explore the tunnels. Meanwhile, Max and Elizabeth find the old rum factory out in the swamp. They enter, but don't find her cousin, only Tauna. They head outside to look in the swamp when suddenly a man's head floats to the surface. Max recognizes it as Puckett's. They run away, but the creature jumps out of a tree and chases them.\n"", ""Dr. Chase examines the stuff in the tunnel but Richland destroys it and threatens Chase. The kids make it to Tauna's house and hide and contact Dr. Chase. Before he can make it back, the creature attacks the house. When he arrives, he finds the house in ruins and believes the children are dead, but they come out of their hiding places. Chief Gibons soon arrives and Elizabeth tells him that the creature exists. He finally accepts the beast's existence. The Chief and Richland lead a hunt for the creature in the swamp. Dr. Chase goes with them and exposes Richland as one of the people present at the original event. He says how Richland's cover-up put people at risk. Richland threatens to kill him, but the Chief stops him. The creature attacks and kills Richland's men. The Chief falls into the water. But instead of saving him, Richland just watches hoping the creature will attack the Chief so he can kill it and finally settle his score. Dr. Chase rescues the Chief. The creature obliterates the bridge where Richland is standing. He falls into the water where the creature eats him. Dr. Chase and the Chief escape and make it back to town the next day.\n"", ""There, the chief is reunited with Elizabeth and finally understands and accepts Dr. Chase as a good man. Dr. Chase, Tall Man, Max, and Dr. Macy return to headquarters where Peniston is waiting. Dr. Macy realizes he was there. She angrily asks him why he did not kill the creature, as she discovers from the recovered notes that the creature is capable of interbreeding with great whites and creating more of its kind. Peniston replies that it was because they used his blood to help create it and that the creature is a part of him. They use Robin with a camera attached to her back to locate the creature. It locates the beast's lair, but before they can retrieve her, the creature attacks and the camera goes blank. Tall Man and Peniston enter the tunnel shortly after. They see the creature eating Robin.  Tall Man shoots at the creature but Peniston interferes. The creature injures Tall Man.\n"", ""Dr. Chase arrives and helps Tall Man escape, but are pursued by the creature. The creature quickly gains the upper hand and almost kills Chase. Max uses Peniston's sound device to distract the creature. It attacks him, but he uses a zipline to escape. Peniston takes the sound device and lures the creature into the pressure chamber. Dr. Chase urges Peniston not to stay in the pressure chamber with the creature, but Peniston refuses to leave saying he can't let the creature die alone. Dr. Chase locks them in and activates it, building greater and greater pressure. The creature kills Peniston. Chase allows the pressure to build up very high then smashes the window causing all the air to come out. This causes explosive decompression and the creature explodes, finally killing it.
